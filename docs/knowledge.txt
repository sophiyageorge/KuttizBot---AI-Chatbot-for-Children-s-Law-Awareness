Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems or machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include:

Understanding language (like Siri, ChatGPT)

Recognizing images or speech (like facial recognition)

Learning from data (like Netflix recommendations)

Making decisions (like self-driving cars or fraud detection)

Simple Definition:
AI is the ability of a machine or computer program to mimic human thinking and decision-making.

Types of AI:
Narrow AI (Weak AI):
AI trained for a specific task (e.g., Google Maps, spam filters).

General AI (Strong AI):
AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge like a human. (Still theoretical)

Super AI:
Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence (in the future).

Key Areas of AI:
Machine Learning (ML): Learning patterns from data

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding human language

Computer Vision: Understanding images/videos

Robotics: AI in physical machines
